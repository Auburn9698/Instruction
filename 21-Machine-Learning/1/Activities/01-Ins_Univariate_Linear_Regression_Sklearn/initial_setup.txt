Make sure that you’ve pulled the most recent version of the class repository as I’ve posted the new section and you’ll need it to do the steps below.
Please try to start the process of installing the new virtual environment called PyAdv.
STEPS:
cd down into the resources directory that I’ve pointed out in the attached screenshot (your full path will be slightly different)
Make sure you don’t have any environment activated (I had to do a bunch of conda deactivate (or possibly source deactivate on Windows) commands but you should only have to do one or two)
Run the following command conda env create --file python_adv.yml

Message at the end:
To activate this environment, use
#
#     $ conda activate PythonAdv
#
# To deactivate an active environment, use
#
#     $ conda deactivate
