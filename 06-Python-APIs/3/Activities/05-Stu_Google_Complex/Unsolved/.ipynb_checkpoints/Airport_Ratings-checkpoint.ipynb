    "In this activity, you are tasked with creating a DataFrame containing the rating of every airport in the top 100 metropolitan areas according to Google Users.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "* Using [05-Stu_Google_Complex/Airport_Ratings.ipynb](Unsolved/Airport_Ratings.ipynb) as a starting point, utilize the Google Geocoding API, the Google Places API, and Python/Jupyter to create a script that lists the \"Airport Rating\" of the major \"International Airport\" in each of the top 100 metropolitan areas found in [05-Stu_Google_Complex/Cities.csv](Resources/Cities.csv).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Your final `ipynb` file should contain each of the following headers: \n",
    "\n",
    "  1. `City`\n",
    "\n",
    "  2. `State`\n",
    "\n",
    "  3. `Lat`\n",
    "\n",
    "  4. `Lng`\n",
    "\n",
    "  5. `Airport Name`\n",
    "\n",
    "  6. `Airport Address`\n",
    "\n",
    "  7. `Airport Rating`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hints\n",
    "\n",
    "* You will need to obtain the lat/lng of each airport prior to sending it through the Google Places API to obtain the rating.\n",
    "\n",
    "* When using the Google Places API, be sure to use the term \"International Airport\" to ensure that the data received is for the major airport in the city and not a regional airport.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use a try-except to skip airports for which there are no Google user's ratings.\n"
